## Akan_Name
Akan name generator is a project based on Ghanaian culture. A user inputs their birthdate, and a name is generated for them depending on the day they were born. We have a landing page that has a short description on the akan naming system and then a form page where user inputs their date and selects gender. Below are the list of names
Male
<ul>
<li>Sunday: Kwasi</li>

<li>Monday: Kwadwo</li>

<li>Tuesday: Kwabena</li>

<li>Wednesday: Kwaku</li>

<li>Thursday:  Yaw</li>

<li>Friday: Kofi</li>

<li>Saturday: Kwame</li>
</ul>
Female
<ul>
<li>Sunday: Akosua</li>

<li>Monday: Aduowa</li>

<li>Tuesday: Abenaa</li>

<li>Wednesday: Akua</li>

<li>Thursday:  Yaa</li>

<li>Friday: Afua</li>

<li>Saturday: Ama</li>
</ul>
